 we can just give the function numbers directly:

You have 30 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party !
Get a blanket.
OR, we can use variables from the script:
You have 10 cheeses !
You have 50 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party !
Get a blanket.
We cam combine two , variables and math:
You have 30 cheeses !
You have 11 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party !
Get a blanket.
And we combine the two ,variables and math:
You have 110 cheeses !
You have 1050 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party !
Get a blanket.
