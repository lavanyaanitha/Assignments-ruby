# Exercise 7 : More printing

# print the string
puts "Mary had a little lamb"
puts "Its fleece was white as snow."
puts "And everywhere that mary went "
# prints the dot operator 20 times
puts "." * 20
# Assume the variable end1 holds the String R
end1='R'
# Assume the variable end2 holds the String u
end2="u"
# Assume the variable end3 holds the String b
end3="b"
# Assume the variable end4 holds the String y
end4="y"
# Assume the variable end5 holds the String l
end5="l"
# Assume the variable end6 holds the String a
end6="a"
# Assume the variable end7 holds the String n
end7="n"
# Assume the variable end8 holds the String g
end8="g"
# Assume the variable end9 holds the String u
end9="u"
# Assume the variable end10 holds the String a
end10="a"
# Assume the variable end11 holds the String g
end11="g"
# Assume the variable end12 holds the String e
end12="e"
# Before printing the value performs the addition operation
print end1+end2+end3+end4+end5+end6
# Before printing the value performs the addition operation
puts end7+end8+end9+end10+end11+end12

# puts = Automatically moves to the next line at the end of each argument
